# Systems Manager Patch Manager
This tool automates patching of your EC2 and on-premises servers.
**What does it handle?**
 ‚úÖ Automatically scans for missing patches
 ‚úÖ Defines patch rules (baselines)
 ‚úÖ Groups servers for patching (Patch Groups)
 ‚úÖ Applies patches in a controlled, environment-aware way
 Key Concepts *Systems Manager Patch Manager*
 1Ô∏è‚É£ *Patch Baseline*
 * This defines which patches should be applied.
Example:
Baseline for Dev: all non-critical + critical patches
Baseline for Prod: only critical patches, with a 7-day wait
üí° Think of it as your ‚Äúapproved patch rulebook‚Äù per environment.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Patch Group
* Logical grouping of EC2 instances based on tags.
* **MUST use the tag key: Patch Group** (this is an AWS rule).
Example:
    Dev instances ‚Üí Patch Group = Dev-Patch
    Prod instances ‚Üí Patch Group = Prod-Patch
üí° Patch Groups connect specific servers to specific baselines.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Tagging
* You must tag EC2 instances properly:
 ‚úÖ By environment
 ‚úÖ By OS type (if needed)
 Example:
Environment: Dev, Patch Group: Dev-Patch
Environment: Prod, Patch Group: Prod-Patch
üí° Without the right tags, Patch Manager can‚Äôt target the right servers.
4Ô∏è‚É£ Patch Compliance
After patching, you can verify what was patched, what failed, and what‚Äôs missing.

# VPC & Networking (Peering, TGW, Direct Connect)
1Ô∏è‚É£ Trap: VPC Peering is NOT transitive.
 ‚û°Ô∏è Even if A ‚ÜîÔ∏è B and B ‚ÜîÔ∏è C, A üö´ cannot talk to C.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Trap: Direct Connect does NOT allow VPC-to-VPC traffic.
 ‚û°Ô∏è It connects on-premises to AWS‚ÄîNOT VPC-to-VPC. Use Transit Gateway + Direct Connect Gateway for multi-VPC routing.
#  IAM & Security (Cross-Account Access, Policies)
1Ô∏è‚É£ Trap: Resource-based policies allow cross-account access WITHOUT switching roles.
    ‚û°Ô∏è Identity-based policies need AssumeRole.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Trap: Trust Policy‚Äôs Principal must point to the external account/user ARN‚ÄîNOT to your own account or role name.

# CloudFront & Encryption
1Ô∏è‚É£ Trap: Field-Level Encryption is needed when encrypting specific sensitive fields (e.g., credit card numbers), not just HTTPS.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Trap: Adding headers (User-Agent, Host) to CloudFront cache key can reduce cache hit ratio, NOT improve it.

# Migration Strategies (6 R‚Äôs)
1Ô∏è‚É£ Trap: If you're migrating NOW with no code changes, it‚Äôs always Rehost‚Äîeven if you plan to refactor later
2Ô∏è‚É£ Trap: Replatform = minor tweaks now (e.g., moving DB to RDS)‚ÄîNOT a full rewrite (that's Refactor).

üß† **Blue/Green works** best when you can duplicate everything and switch over cleanly.
‚ùå It‚Äôs not ideal when apps need live state coordination, feature flags, or have tight upgrade paths (like COTS apps).

# Security Groups vs NACLs
1Ô∏è‚É£ Trap: Security Groups are stateful (return traffic auto-allowed); NACLs are stateless (must allow return traffic explicitly).
2Ô∏è‚É£ Trap: NACLs evaluate rules in order (lowest # first). First match WINS. SGs evaluate all rules together.

# Direct Connect & VPN
1Ô∏è‚É£ Trap: VPN is over the internet (IPSec encrypted), while Direct Connect is a dedicated private connection.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Trap: Public VIF (Virtual Interface) on Direct Connect is for public AWS services (e.g., S3), NOT for private VPC access. For VPC access, you need a Private VIF.

# S3 Access & Encryption
1Ô∏è‚É£ Trap: Bucket policies (resource-based) can grant cross-account access directly. IAM user policies alone can‚Äôt do this unless combined with AssumeRole.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Trap: S3 encryption:
SSE-S3 = AWS manages keys
SSE-KMS = You manage keys via KMS
 ‚û°Ô∏è **SSE-KMS requires extra permission to use the key (kms:Decrypt, etc.).**
 # IPSEC VPN and VPC 

 1Ô∏è‚É£ IPSec tunnels are built for ‚Äúon-prem to AWS,‚Äù not AWS VPC to AWS VPC.
 2Ô∏è‚É£ Instead of IPSec, AWS gives you:
  * VPC Peering
  * Transit Gateway (TGW)

‚û°Ô∏è These are AWS-native solutions that use the AWS backbone network‚Äîthey don‚Äôt need IPSec tunnels.

üö® KEY PHRASE TO MEMORIZE:
 üëâ ‚ÄúAWS does NOT provide native IPSec VPN tunnels between two VPCs; use VPC Peering or Transit Gateway instead.‚Äù

| Tracks & records the state of your resources (configuration history).       | Lets you manage servers, install patches, run commands, automate ops tasks. |
| Continuously checks if resources meet compliance rules.                     | Example: ‚ÄúPatch my EC2 Linux machines. Run a script across all servers.‚Äù |
| Example: ‚ÄúAre my S3 buckets public? Is my IAM policy too open?‚Äù            |                                                                     |

| ‚úÖ **Best for:** Auditing, compliance, security monitoring.                 | ‚úÖ **Best for:** Automation, maintenance, operational tasks.         |

üö® The BIG TRAP to Remember for the Exam:
üëâ **If the question is about:**
‚ùì Compliance, auditing, continuously checking policies or configs:
 ‚û°Ô∏è ‚úÖ **AWS Config is the answer.**


‚ùì Running commands, patching servers, automating operational tasks:
 ‚û°Ô∏è ‚úÖ **WS Systems Manager (SSM) is the answer.**


üí° Easy phrase:
üîë ‚ÄúConfig = Compliance. SSM = SysAdmin tasks.‚Äù
‚úÖ When question says:
‚ÄúUser keeps working in their account + no need to switch roles‚Äù ‚ûî ‚úÖ Resource-based policy.

# üöÄ  How to Improve Cache Hit Ratio:

|--------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Cache-Control max-age (longer TTL)         | The longer CloudFront can cache content, the fewer times it goes back to the origin.           |
| Minimize unnecessary headers/query strings | CloudFront caches per unique request. Extra headers/query strings can cause cache misses.      |
| Compress objects (gzip/brotli)             | Reduces size = faster = more cache-friendly.                                                   |
| Use Origin Shield                          | Adds another caching layer closer to your origin, improving cache hit ratio for multi-region requests. |
| Versioned URLs (e.g., /v1/logo.png)        | Lets you cache forever (long TTL) and force refresh only when you change the file (by changing the URL). |

## Mobile App Authentication Best Practices

- Mobile apps that use Google/Facebook login = **Web Identity Federation + STS + temporary creds**
- ‚ùå **Never** hardcode access keys into mobile apps.
- ‚úÖ **Always** let users log in with their identity provider and get temporary access to AWS.


| Federation Type         | Use Case                                                                 | STS API Used                      | Credential Type                           | Best For                                           | Security Risk                           |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Web Identity Federation | Mobile/web apps using Google, Facebook, or OIDC login                   | AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity         | Temporary credentials (via STS)           | Apps where users log in with social accounts       | Low (uses short-lived tokens)           |
| SAML Federation         | Enterprise users with corporate credentials (e.g., ADFS, AD)            | AssumeRoleWithSAML                | Temporary credentials (via STS)           | Enterprise SSO and centralized user management     | Low (tokens expire)                     |
| Cognito                 | User sign-up/sign-in with AWS-hosted identity/user pools                | Cognito handles internally with STS | Temporary credentials (via STS)           | Consumer apps with user directory and auth mgmt    | Low (tokens + user pool auth)           |
| IAM Users               | Static, long-lived AWS identities (not federated)                       | Not applicable                    | Long-term access keys (manually rotated)  | Scripts, CLI use, admin users (bad for apps)       | High (long-term keys can be leaked)     |

# Ldap and Identity broker

‚úÖ What is an Identity Broker?
An identity broker is like a translator and gatekeeper between:
üßë Your corporate identity system (LDAP, AD, etc.)

üîÑ It does 3 main jobs:
Authenticate the user using LDAP


Map the authenticated user to an IAM Role in AWS


Request temporary AWS credentials from STS using AssumeRole


‚òÅÔ∏è AWS Security Token Service (STS)

Your identity broker sits between LDAP and AWS


It verifies the user credentials against LDAP


If successful, it calls AWS STS (AssumeRole) and gives back temporary AWS credentials


The web app calls the broker and uses the credentials returned to access AWS

**User ‚Üí Web App ‚Üí Identity Broker ‚Üí LDAP + STS ‚Üí Temporary AWS creds**
**Mental model: LDAP ‚Üí Broker ‚Üí STS ‚Üí AWS creds**

| Step | What Happens                                               |
|------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| 1Ô∏è‚É£   | User logs into web app with LDAP credentials              |
| 2Ô∏è‚É£   | Web app or broker verifies credentials against LDAP       |
| 3Ô∏è‚É£   | If valid, it calls AWS STS: AssumeRole                   |
| 4Ô∏è‚É£   | Gets temporary credentials for that IAM role              |
| 5Ô∏è‚É£   | App uses those creds to access S3, DynamoDB, etc.         |

Memory Hook
**‚ÄúLDAP can‚Äôt talk to IAM directly‚ÄîSTS is the translator, and the identity broker is the bouncer.‚Äù**

| Component      | Purpose                                  |
|----------------|------------------------------------------|
| LDAP           | Corporate user authentication            |
| Identity Broker| Maps LDAP user to IAM role and calls STS |
| STS            | Issues temporary AWS credentials         |
| IAM Role       | Controls what the user can access in AWS |

‚úÖ Benefits of Identity Broker
üîê No need for long-term IAM users or access keys
üîÅ Temporary credentials that auto-expire
üõ°Ô∏è Strong access control using IAM roles
üîÑ Works with any identity provider (LDAP, SAML, OIDC)

| Concept                | Example                                                        |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| You control the key    | You create it yourself, AWS never stores it                    |
| You send the key       | Every time you upload/download, you must include the key       |
| AWS encrypts for you   | But only temporarily, then forgets the key                     |
| Headers matter         | You must send 3 headers with API/SDK/CLI calls                 |


"You can‚Äôt change your VPC‚Äôs original block, but you CAN expand it with 4 more CIDRs."

 # RDS 

 **Why CNAME, Not IP Address?**
RDS gives your DB instance a CNAME DNS endpoint like:

 CopyEdit
mydb.abcdefghij.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com


This CNAME always points to the current primary


AWS flips it behind the scenes during failover

That‚Äôs why apps should **always connect using the RDS endpoint** and not the underlying IP‚Äîbecause IPs change on failover, but the **CNAME stays the same.*

Multi-AZ = standby is on standby. If primary dies, AWS promotes standby and flips the CNAME‚Äîfast, smooth, automatic.
