OSI 7 Layer of Model -- Conceptual How each components works and interact with others


| OSI Model Layers | Description                                                                              |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Host Layer**   | How data is segmented and reassembled for transport, and formatted for mutual understanding. |
| Layer 7 - Application | (Web Browser/Web Server)                                                                |
| Layer 6 - Presentation  |                                                                                         |
| Layer 5 - Session     |                                                                                         |
| Layer 4 - Transport   |                                                                                         |
| **Media Layer**  | How data is transmitted from point A to point B.                                        |
| Layer 3 - Network     |                                                                                         |
| Layer 2 - Data Link   |                                                                                         |
| Layer 1 - Physical    | (Network card or interface)                                                             |



## Layer 1 Physical | DUMB layer just standards |
* Median to carry unstructured inforamtion
* Medium can be Copper(electrical) Fiber(light) (Wifi RF)
* Specification denies the transmission and reception of RAW BIT STREAM between a device and shared physical medium. It defines things like
Voltage level, timing, rates and distance, modulation and connectors
* Network devices undersands Binary 1 and Binary 0 based on the agreed upon standards
    - Binary 0 and 1 and specific voltage type that both the connecting devices agree on

* **HUB**-- Anything received on any port is transmitted on every other port *including errors and collisions*, hub have a single collision domain.
* layer 1 is broadcast medium
* No individual devices address 
* All the data is processed by all devices 
* If multiple devices transmits at once -- a collision occurs therefore only 1 devices can transmit the data
* L1 has no media access control and no collision detection
* no access control
* No device to device communication
* More devices hence more collisions 

## LAYER 2 Data LINK layer | THE MOST CRITICAL LAYER|

Layer 2 can run on different types of **Layer 1 (Ethernet|fibar|wifi|**

* **FRAMES** -- Are the format for sending the infromation to the over layer 2
* **MAC address** -- hardware address - 48 bits long - MAC is hardware layer- made by manufacture is **globally unique**
	- Written as six pairs of hexadecimal digits (e.g., AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF)
	- Made out of OUI (Organizationally Unique Identifier) â€“ 24 bits and device identifer bits
* **Frame layout**
    - **Preamble**(start of the frame) 56 bits SFS **8 bit**, allows devices to know that this is the start of the frame.
    - **Destination MAC Address** Layer 2 to address of destination device.
    - **Source MAC Address** Layer 2 address of the source device, device transmitting the frame
    - **Ether Type** **16 bits**, contains the information of IP or the internet protocol, which layer 3 protocol originally put data into that frame.
    Preamble, Destination, MAC Address, Source MAC Address and Ether Type are called as **MAC HEADER**
    - **Payload** Anywhere from 46 to 1500 bites, contains the data that the frame is sending.Data is generally provided by the layer 3 protocol and EtherType attributes defines which L3 protocol is used. 
    - **FCS** **32 bit** To check if the corruption has occurred or not.
* Layer 2 provides controlled access to the physical medium.
* Imagine a 2 PC connected by an ethernet cable left PC and write PC
* [**Carrier Sense Multiple Access (CSMA)**](https://www.ccbp.in/blog/articles/csma-in-computer-networks#:~:text=Carrier%20Sense%20Multiple%20Access%20(CSMA)%20is%20a%20network%20protocol%20that,Ethernet%20network%20or%20wireless%20environment.) is a network protocol that operates in the data link layer (Layer 2) of the OSI model. It is designed to prevent collisions when multiple devices attempt to transmit data simultaneously over a shared medium, such as an Ethernet network or wireless environment
  
   - Left player intends to send data to mac address 3e:22:fb:b9:5b:76 layer 2 creates a frame F1
   - Then left PC will check for the carrier
   - If no carrier, layer 1 takes the frame, converts to physical standard and transmits
   - L1(Right) Receives and passes frame to layer 2.
   - When the right game needs to send to left game, its layer 2 builds a frame.
   - If carrier is detected, then wait another device is transmitting.
   - Frame sent to layer 1 for transmission.
**Collsion Detention** this is essential for layer 2 
**Hub** Does not avoid collision as it is a layer 1 device.
**Switch** Is a layer 2 device just like hub however understands layer 2, hence provides significant advantages.
    - Switch understands **frame** and **MAC Address**. They maintain a mac address table which starts off empty.
    - As the swtich receives frames on its ports, it learns which devices are connected and populates the Mac address table.
    - Switch will limit collision. 
    - Switch deals with frames only, if it is valid, it then forwards it.
    - We can do unicast meaning 1:1 communication.
    - We can do Broadcast 1: All communication.

## Layer 3 Network layer

* Layer 3 is a common protocol which can spam multiple different layer 3 networks.
* Internet Protocol (IP) is a layer 3 protocol which adds cross network IP addressing and routing to move data between Local Area Netwrok
* IP packets are moved step by step from source to destination via intermediate networks. Encapsulated in different frames along the way.
* **Routers** Is a layer 3 devices which moves packets of Data across different networks.
* Router devices remvoed frame encapsulation and add new frame encapsulation at every hop.
  
- Layer 3 IP V4 packet structure only important ones:
    - Protocol
    - Source IP address
    - Destination IP address
    - DATA(By Layer 4)
    - Time to Live(TTL) How many hops a packets can take before getting discarded.
- Layer 3 IP V6 packet structure only important ones:
  
    - Source IP address (Bigger Large address)
    - Destination IP address (Bigger Large address)
    - Data From layer 4
    - Hop Limit
* **Ip addressing** *Structre of IP Version 4*
  
    - 133.33.3.7 (Dotted decimal notation) 4 X 0-255
    - 133.33 is the network part
    - 3.7 is the host part
    - if the network part of two IP address matches, it means they are on the same IP network, if not the are on the different networks.
    - Each decimal part of the IP address is an **8 bit binary** octets number like following:
  
      -10000101 00100001 00000011 00000111   
    - The above network has a 16 prefix. 16 bits of the IP are the network and the remaining bits are for hosts
    - so 133.33.33.37 are in same network
    - If the network component of the device matches then the device is local other wise it is remote.
    - Ip address are assigned by either humans (Static IP) or assigned by a machine called DHCP(Dynamic Host configuration)
* **Subnet Mask**
  - It is the subnet mask which allows a host of determine if an IP address it needs to communicate with is local or remote- which influences if it needs to use gateway or can communicate locally. 
  - Home router is default gateway
  - Subnet mask tells us which part of the IP is in the network
  - A subnet mask si configured on a host device in addition to an IP address, eg **255.225.0.0** and this is the same as **/16** prefix.
  - 11111111 11111111 00000000 00000000 --**SUBNET MASK**
  - 10000101 00100001 00000011 00000111 --**IP ADDRESS**

    - IP address and the subnet mask start with 1 hence they are in the same network
  
 **Route Tables** *How packets gets transferred from home to destination*
    - Packet SRC 1.3.3.7(Home) Destination 52.217.13.37 Default route 0.0.0.0/0 sends all the packets to ISP(Internet service provider)
    - ISP has multiple interface route table is used for selection
    - Based on the Route table of ISP router
  
| Destination     | Next Hop/Target |
|---------------------|---------------------|
| 52.217.13.0/24       | 52.217.13.1         |
| 0.0.0.0/0           | 52.43.217.1         |
| 52.43.215.0/24      | 52.43.215.1         |


   - Router compares packet destination IP and route table matching destination. The more specific prefix are preferred(0 lowest, 32 highest). Packet is forwarded on to the next Hop/Target
   - Routing is the process where the packet hop by hop across the internet from source to destination(Mac address of router)
   - ARP(Address resolution Protocol L3 work) protocol will give you the mac address of the given IP address
   - Limitation -- 
     - No method for channels of communication  SRC IP <=> DIST IP Only
     - IP can be delivered out of order

## Layer 4 Transport layer and Layer 5 session layer

Issues with layer 3:
 1. Un-ordered packets leaving layer 3.
 2. Missing packets in layer 3.
 3. Delay in delivery
 4. There are no communication channel packets have a source and destination IP but no method of splitting by APP or Channel.
 5. No flow control, if the source transmits faster than the destination can receive it can saturate the destination causing the packet loss.
   
Note: Every packet is different.

**What is layer 4 and how does it fuction?** 

**yer 4 adds protocol:**
1. TCP - Reliability, error correction and ordering of data.
   1. It is used for most important application layer protocol like HTTP,HTTPS,SSH and so on
   2. TCP is connection oriented communication channel, once setup it creates a bidirectional channel for communication.
   3. Slower  
2. UDP - Less Reliable and faster than TCP.

TCP segments are incapsulated within the IP packets.
Segment don't have src and destination IP's the packets provide device addressing

**TCP SEGMENT** aka TCP header
   1. Source port
   2. Destination port
   3. sequence number
   4. Acknowledgement
   5. Flag 'N' Things 
   6. Window
   7. Checksum 
   8. Urgent pointers
   9. Options
   10. Padding
   11. Data

A TCP segment is the fundamental unit of data transmission in the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), used for reliable communication between a client and a server over a network.


**How segment is used in TCP** /**Architecture of TCP**

TCP is a connection based protocol. A connection is established between two devices using a random port on a client and known port on the server.

Once established the connection is **BI-Directional** The connection is reliable connection, provided via the segment encapsulation in IP packets.

In L3 packets - No Error checking, no ordering no association.

Segment linked to a connection ordering and retransmission.IF packet is lost or unordered the TCP can manage the both the issues.
Channels are created using segment and they are Bi-directional, one for client to server and another for server to client.

There are 2 kinds of port when used in TCP communication:

1. **Well KNOWN PORT** A server port like TCP 443 for HTTPS.
2. **Ephemeral Port** A temporary port that a client uses to communicate to the server.Temporary ports that a client picks as the source port when initiating a connection to a server. These ports are dynamically assigned by the operating system from a predefined range and are used for the duration of the sess

It is important to understand that the for layer 4 perspective that the 2 way communication will be from Ephemeral port to well known port and vise versa. 
One set of rules for laptop to server and another set of rule from server to laptop.

When we mention ephemeral port, it means a port range that a client picks as a source port. These should be allowed back to the client as firewall rules on the server.

That's why you need 2 sets of rules for NETWORK ACL(Access control list within AWS)(State full)

**TCP Connection 3 way handshake** *has 4 steps*

**Step 1** Client sends a **SYN** Send a segment with SYN sequence set 'CS'(ISN) Initial sequence number -- *sequence = cs*.
**Step 2** Server sends  **SYN-ACK**, picks random ISN sequence 'ss' send segment -**SYN** and **ACK** Acknowledge sets to **CS+1**, I have received up tp CS send CS+1.
**Step 3** Client send segment with **ACK** send segment with ACK Acknowledge set to **SS+1**, I have received SS, send SS+1 sequence set to CS+1
**Step 4** The connection is established and the client can send data.

**Session and the state**

 **State less firewall** Network ACL (AWS) has 2 rules one for outbound and another one inbound. As it does not understand the state of TCP connection.

 A **Stateful** firewall views TCP connection as one thing outbound, LAPTOP-IP and TCP 23060 => server IP and TCP port/443 allowing the outbound implicitly allows the inbound response.

# NAT Network Address Translation

 NAT is fundamental technology used in computer networking to allow multiple devices to share a single PUBLIC IP address. 

 1. Nat is used to designed to overcome IPv4 Shortages.
 2. Private IP address like 10.0.0.0 are used in multiple places and can't be used over internet.
 3. To give internet access to private devices we need to use NAT
 4. NAT also provides some security benefits too
 5. NAT only works for IPV4 and not for IPV6
 6. There are many kinds of NAT but they all translate Private IPV4 address to Public:
    1. **Static Nat** - 1 private to 1 fixed public address (IGW) in both ways.
       1. From Private zone -- a device Ip(Private) are mapped to 1:1 Public IP in by a static NAT in AWS knows as Internet Gateway
       2. Packets are generate as normal with a private source (SRC) IP, and an external Destination DST(IP)
       3. IF a public IP has been allocated to the private IP, the source address of the packet is translates as it passes through the NAT device
       4. The same process is works in both direction from public to private
    2. **Dynamic NAT** -1 private to 1st available public
       1. Public IP allocation are temporary and multiple devices can use the same allocation over time as long as there is no overlap
       2. If the public IP Pool is exhausted then external access can fail
       3. Only one Private IP will be mapped to one Public IP address mapping at any time. It is still 1:1 for the duration of the allocation
    3. **Port address translation (PAT)** many private to 1 public NATGW
       1. In AWS this is how the NATGatway(NATGW) function - a (Many:1)(Private:PublicIP)Architecture 
       2. The NAT Device records the source (Private)IP and source Port.
       3. It replaces the source IPO with single Public IP and Public source port allocated from a pool which allows IP overloading (many to one)
       4. Return Traffic has tcp/443 and 1.3.3.7 as the source and the public IP of the NAT device adn destination
       5. Public port and public IP are translated to Private Port and Private IP
       6. Port address translation PAT maintains a NAT table with following content:
       Private IP Private Port Public IP Public Port

| NAT Entry | Private IP    | Private Port | Public IP     | Public Port |
|-----------|--------------|--------------|---------------|-------------|
| 1         | 10.0.0.100   | 1024         | 155.4.12.1    | 20345       |
| 2         | 10.0.0.101   | 1056         | 155.4.12.1    | 20346       |
| 3         | 10.0.0.102   | 1025         | 155.4.12.1    | 20347       |
| 4         | 10.0.0.103   | 1100         | 155.4.12.1    | 20348       |


*How does my laptop private IP address gets its public IP*

| Device | IP Type    | Who Assigns It        | Visibility          |
|--------|------------|----------------------|---------------------|
| Laptop | Private IP | Router (via DHCP)    | Local network only  |
| Router | Public IP  | ISP                  | Visible on internet |

If you want your laptop to be accessible from the internet (for example, to run a server), you would need to configure port forwarding on your router to direct external traffic to your laptopâ€™s private IP address. However, this does not give your laptop a public IP; it simply allows certain types of incoming traffic to reach your laptop through the router

## IP Addressing and Subnetting

1. IpV4 standard created in 1981.. RFC791
2. 0.0.0.0 -> 255.255.255.255 = 4,294,967,296 address 4.294 Billion
3. IPV 6 is needed because worlds population is over 8 Billion
4. Origianlly, directed managed by IANA
5. Internet Assingned Number Authority
6. All public IPV4 addressing is **allocated**,.. it just can't be picked up and expect to be work on Internet.
7. Parts of the address space is private and can be used/reused freely
8. IP address class:
   1. **Class A:** Given to HUGE organization or big orgs in early days of internet (APPLE, FORD etc)
      1. Starts with 0.0.0.0 Ends 127.255.255.255 128 Networks 167772163 IPs each 
      2. 0 (Reserved) 1. 2 ..127

      2. 2097152 Network 256 IP Each
      3. 192.0.1,192.0.2..End with 223.255.255.255
   4. **Class D** is used for multi cast
   5. **Class E** reserved
9. Private IP are defined in standard document RFC1918
   1.  This doc defined 3 ranges of IP 
        1.  **10**.0.0.0 -10.255.255.255 (**1 X Class A** network) 16,777,216 IPV6 address

## IP Subnetting
1. Cider 
2. 10.16.0.0/16(prefix)(class A, private class A) the first 2 octet are network and rest is available for hosts for subnetting 
3. larger the prefix value smaller the network
4. splitting of 10.16.0.0/16 ---->spiting the network in 2
   1. /16 => 2 */ 
      1. 17 10.16.0.0/17

         2. 10.16.64.0/18
      2. 10.16.128.0/17--> /17 =>2 */18 2 smaller nets
         1. 10.16.128.0/18
         2. 10.16.192.0/18
5. Network are usually split into 2,4,8 while unusual, odd number splits are valid
6. Subnetting is the process of taking a larger network and breaking it into more smaller network(higher prefix)

## Distributed Denial of Service attact
1. Attacks designed to overload website 
2. Complete against legitimate connection
3. Distributed hard to block individual Ip/Ranges
4. Application layer HTTP Flood
5. Protocol Attack -- **SYN** Flood
6. Volumetic DNS Amplification attacks
7. DDos attacks are often inlovs large armies of compromise machines (Botnets)

# Vlans,Trunks and Q in Q

**How we support Vlans in layer 2 OSI model?**

Ethernet frame has following sections:

|Preamble 56 Bits SFD 8 bit | Destination MAC address | Source MAC Address| ET 16 Bits| Payload 46 to 1500 bytes | FCS 32 Bits|

**802.1Q** Changes the frame format by adding a new filed, a 32 bit field in the middle in cyan. Hence the by adding a 32 field between ET and source MAC, the min (64 bytes) and max(1518 bytes) Frame size can be extended to allow for the 4 byte filed.

|Preamble 56 Bits SFD 8 bit | Destination MAC address | Source MAC Address| 802.1Q 32 Bits|ET 16 Bits| Payload 46 to 1500 bytes | FCS 32 Bits|

12 bits of the 802.1Q field allow for the **4096 value**. O is reserve for NO VAL and 1 is often MGMT VLAN.

802.1Q allows multiple "Virtual LANS(Vlans)" to operate over the same L2 physical network. Each has a separate broadcast domain and is isolated from all others.

**802.1AD** |Preamble 56 Bits SFD 8 bit | Destination MAC address | Source MAC Address|802.1Q 32 Bits| 802.1Q 32 Bits|ET 16 Bits| Payload 46 to 1500 bytes | FCS 32 Bits|

Adds an additional VLANS field the 1st is known as S-TAG (Service TAG)....These second C-TAG (Customer TAG).
QinQ(802.IAD) allows ISP or carrier to use VLAN across their network, while carrying customers traffic which might also be using multiple VLANS

**How .Q works?**


1. 802.1Q Switches set ports as either ACCESS port(WHich are generally set to one VLAN ID or TRUNK port)
2. An access port generally has just one specific VLAN ID.
3. A trunk generally has all the VLAN ID associated with it
4. When a frames through an ACCESS port to the switch its VLAN ID added
5. A Tagged Frame will only be sent to access port with the same VID or over a TRUNK port
6. Access Port communicate with the station using normal ethernet(No VLAN Tagging)
7. WHen a TAGGED frame enters an access port, any VID is removed
8. Devices on different VLANS communicates without a Layer 3 Devices(Router)


**Important points for Vlan**
1. Vlans help in creating a separate L2 network segements
2. This provides isolation of traffic
3. If we don't add router then the frames cannot leave the VLAN boundry. 
4. VLANs are needed to access different networks by AWS Direct Connect VPCs)
5. Vlans offer separate broadcast domains as they create completely separate virtual network segment
6. 802.1Q means (VLANS) abd 802.1AD (nested Q in Q VLANS)

## Decimal to Binary conversion

133.33.33.7 ---> Dotted Decimal Notation 32 bit in size
4 sets of 8 bits binary number --> 10000101.00100001.00100001.00000111
8 bits is known as byte each byte is also known as OCTETS

Each "Decimal Number" between dots it has a value between 0-255 do each part 1 by 1.

Example of conversion of 133.33.33.7
133 larger/equal than 128 (rule 2) 133-128 = 5 (new decimal number) add "1" in the binary position.
5 larger/equal than 4 rule 2 (5-4)=1 new decimal number add "1" in Binary position.
1 is smaller than 2 rule 1 add 0 and move on



**Binary Table**

| Position                | 1   | 2  | 3  | 4  | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 |
|-------------------------|-----|----|----|----|---|---|---|---|
| Binary Position Value   | 128 | 64 | 32 | 16 | 8 | 4 | 2 | 1 |
| Binary Value            | 1   | 0  | 0  | 0  | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 |




**Rules to follow**
```
 1. Move through the Binary table left to right
 2. Compare decimal number to Binary position value, if smaller write 0 => move on to the next table position, goto #1
 3. IF it is EQUAL OR LARGER -MINUS the binary position Value from your decimal number and 1 in the binary value column
 4. Move on the next position, goto #1 (With the new decimal value)
 ```

 10000101 = 128+0+0+0+0+4+0+1= 133
 00100001 = 0+0+32+0+0+0+0+1 = 33
 00100001 = 0+0+32+0+0+0+0+1 = 33
 00000111 = 0+0+0+0+0+4+2+1  = 7

 ## SSL and TLS
 
 1. Provide privacy and data integrity between client and server
 2. TLS provides a few Function together with SSL
 3. TLS ensures privacy makes sure that communication between server and client is encrypted
 4. TLS uses trustless asymmetric trustless encryption(meaning no need to transfer the keys over any medium) where server makes its encryption key public to any client so that the client can encrypt data but only that server can decrypt.
 5. TLS moves from assymmetric to symmetric
 6. TLS also provides full two way verification for server and client, generally it is the client that is verifying the server
 7.  TLS provides reliable connection and protects against alternation of data and TLS can detect alteration of the data

**SSL and TLS stages** *every time you use HTTPS*

**Cipher suites**
TLS Begins with an established TCP connection, Agree the method of communication the "cipher suits"
Client says hello to the server, SSL/TLS version, list of supported chipher suites, session ID extensions
IF the server pics up the the Server says hello and SSL/TLS version, list of supported cipher suites, At this point the client and server have agreed how to communicate and client has the server certificate. The certificate contains the server public keys

**Authentication**

Now clients ensures that server certificate is authentic, verifying the server as legitimate. so the server has certificate (contains, Public ket the DNS name, other organizational information)

Public trusted certificate Authority (CA)- Your OS/Browser trust this
(past) server generates and a certificate signing request(CSR) the public CA generates a signed certificate.

In authentication stage, the client trusts the public CA it makes sure that the certificate is valid (date and hasn't been revoked) and that the DNS name matches the name/names on the cert

Then the client encrypts the data and sends some random data to server by encrypting the data by private key present in the certificate. 

**Key Exchnages**

The client generates the pre master key, encrypts it with the server public key and sends it to the server.

The server decrypts the pre master key using its private key

Then both the sides uses the same pre master key to generate the master secret which is used to generate the ongoing session keys which encrypts and decrypts data

Now at this point both sides confirms the handshake and from them on communication between client <=> server are encrypted.

# BGP
Border Gateway Protocol is a routing protocol, which is used to control how data control how data moves from point A to B to C.

BGP is made up by lot of Autonomous System (AS)(Viewed as Black Box) collection or routers controlled by one entity ..a network in BGP.

Each autonomous system is allocated by a number by [IANA](https://www.iana.org/), They are 16 bits in length, ASN are unique and allocated by IANA (0-65535),64512-65534 are private.

BGP operates over TCP/179 its reliable

It is not automatic- peering needs to be done manually configured.

BGP is a path vector protocol it exchanges the best path to a destination between peers.. the path is called the ASPATH.

BGP is not concerned about speed of transfering the data between A to D points, however it is focused on giving the best route from A to D

iBGP = internal BGP - Routing within as Autonomous system
eBGP = External BGP External BGP - Routing between Autonomous System 

BGP always makes decision based on the path length.
An AS will advertise all the shortest path it knows to all its peers, the AS prepends its own AS number onto the path, this creates a source to destination path which BGP routers can learn and propagate.


BGP is the protocol used for dynamic routing between on-premises networks and AWS VPCs, especially over AWS Direct Connect and Site-to-Site VPNs. 
Understanding BGP is crucial for designing, implementing, and troubleshooting hybrid architectures-an exam focus area.BGP is designed for large-scale, multi-network environments and is the standard for inter-domain routing on the internet and in enterprise cloud deployments.

It allows you to efficiently manage thousands of routes, which is essential for complex AWS environments and multi-region architectures

AWS Direct Connect and Site-to-Site VPN both rely on BGP for exchanging routing information between AWS and your on-premises infrastructure.BGP is also relevant for Transit Gateway and advanced multi-account, multi-region network designs

# Jumbo frames and how they are supported in AWS

If the payload to the frame is 1500 bytes then it is called a JUMBo frame 
More payload per frame overhead = more efficient
More payload per frame = less frames = less waste between frames
Not everything in AWS supports jumbo frames.

**With in AWS Jumbo frames consideration**

Traffic outside of a single VPC does not support jumbo frames.
Traffic over an inter-region VPC peering connection 
Same region peering supports jumbo frames
Traffic over VPN connection does not support jumbo frames
Traffic over an internet gateway does not support jumbo frames
You are able to support jumbo frames over direct connect 
TGW does support jumbo frames upto 8500 bytes
